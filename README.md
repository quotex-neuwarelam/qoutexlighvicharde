## How to Get Your Quotex Affiliate Account Reinstated

If your Quotex affiliate account has been suspended, you should take the
following steps to try to get it reinstated:

1.  **Contact Quotex support.** The first step is to contact Quotex
    support and explain why you believe your account was suspended. Be
    polite and professional, and provide as much detail as possible.
2.  **Review the Quotex affiliate program terms and conditions.** Make
    sure that you have not violated any of the terms and conditions. If
    you have, you will need to take steps to rectify the situation.
3.  **Stop using any marketing practices that may be considered
    fraudulent or unethical.** This includes using misleading or
    deceptive advertising, sending spam emails, or creating fake
    accounts.

    that you are not promoting it to individuals in countries where it
    is illegal or restricted.

    sales.

    your new account if you have violated the terms and conditions of
    your previous account.
